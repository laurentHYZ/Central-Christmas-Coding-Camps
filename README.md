# Python

Coding Python is THE coding language you or your child should start with. Either trust me or look it up online, there is little to no debate about that really:)

# Central Christmas Coding Camps


<a id="org173a23a"></a>

## Who are those camps for?

Is your child is between +6 yo?
Fluent in english?
Willing to learn coding and have fun doing so?
Let&rsquo;s get in touch

## Central Christmas Coding Camp (CCCC)

In small groups (6 students or less), we will

-   learn coding basics (using Python)
-   learn touch-typing (盲打)
-   workout (with coding-basics hidden everywhere)

## Some details about the CCCC

-   Coding ala Montessori 解释概念用木块儿: Within camp, any aspect of coding/python that requires conceptual understanding will be ingrained through games with wooden props. That’s coding ala Montessori 木块儿编程.
-   Coding as an english dialect 编程就像普通离线英语教， Any aspect of coding/python that is simply linguistic will taught just like any other language (explaining the grammar on the whiteboard, exercises done with pen and papers)
-   Coding as a textual game 文字酷化有必要: Online textual python games will be used to introduce a little bit of fun 编程酷化. This will make it fun for the kids, but we won’t get into the bells and whistles of robotics.
-   Touch-typing as a foundational skill 展开眼界盲盲打. Touch-typing is the ability to type and edit text with proper posture and without looking at your hands. This skill will have a dramatic effect on the work capacity of any student or or knowledge worker. Good touch-typing is also the most direct way to have a positive impact on spinal health.
-   Computer-related english 电脑和网络术语 Children and adults alike quite often have problems with the most basic computer-related terms. This is all the more important as remote/online learning is becoming the new normal. It is sad to see how children otherwise fluent in English struggle online because they do not understand simple words such as: browser, search-engine, sign-up, login etc
-   Code&Sweat 出汗编程跳跳吧 A healthy mind in a healthy body Code&Sweat is basically a sport-class where I will gradually introduce instructions/commands using python-english instead of natural english.

## Schedule

-   a little bit of theory:
    Each daily training consists of 3\*20 mn class
-   a lot of practice:
    After the theory, participants will work in pairs through their circuit-training (similar to crossfit WOD, but for coding)
-   a little bit of sweat too:
    40 mn of Physical Education
-   lunch

# Q&A

Do not hesitate to leave your questions through Line or Wechat

-   My child took part in former camps with you, what are the differences that we can expect?

Printed material distributed prior to each lesson

Much longer sessions (1h–>3h)
Printed material distributed prior to each lesson
Daily recording of participants’ performance shared with the parents
Daily short recording of child’s performance shared with the group
Introduction of Code&Sweat and online textual games
Touch-typing and computer-related English is introduced
One online textual coding game is introduced.

-   Can my child take part in all camps?

Yes it is possible. Ideally put your kid in workdays camp and let him rest during weekends UNLESS she really wants to take part in the weekend classes. If I had the chance to register my kid to this class I would put him on 3 workdays camp and no weekend camp. If your kid can not make it to a workdays camp, weekends camps are possible as well.

-   Are they going to learn new things from one week to another?

Yes, there will be plenty of new things while at the same time each child will probably dedicate one hour a day to work drill knowledge from the previous day.

-   Coding is interesting, but I think a 1-week camp will be enough

You know best what to do. In this bootcamp series I am incorporating some very important competences (namely touch-typing and Computer-related english), so if you think that 1-week is enough I would still urge you to make sure that your child works on those 2 areas one way or another.

-   What is the target age?

6 till 12 I will pair match kids and have them work on their own.

-   I am not available in the morning, can we organize something similar in the afternoon?

Please Line of Wechat me
