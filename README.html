<h2 id="1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Python</h2>
<p>
Coding Python is THE coding language you or your child should start with. Either trust me or look it up online, there is little to no debate about that really:)

<h3 id="2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Who are those camps for?</h3>
<p>
Is your child is between +6 yo?
Fluent in english?
Willing to learn coding and have fun doing so?
Let&rsquo;s get in touch
</p>

<section id="slide-2-2">
<h3 id="2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Central Christmas Coding Camp (CCCC)</h3>
<p>
In small groups (6 students or less), we will
</p>

<ul>
<li>learn coding basics (using Python)</li>
<li>learn touch-typing (盲打)</li>
<li>workout (with coding-basics hidden everywhere)</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-2-3">
<h3 id="2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Some details about the CCCC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coding ala Montessori 解释概念用木块儿: Within camp, any aspect of coding/python that requires conceptual understanding will be ingrained through games with wooden props. That’s coding ala Montessori 木块儿编程.</li>
<li>Coding as an english dialect 编程就像普通离线英语教， Any aspect of coding/python that is simply linguistic will taught just like any other language (explaining the grammar on the whiteboard, exercises done with pen and papers)</li>
<li>Coding as a textual game 文字酷化有必要: Online textual python games will be used to introduce a little bit of fun 编程酷化. This will make it fun for the kids, but we won’t get into the bells and whistles of robotics.</li>
<li>Touch-typing as a foundational skill 展开眼界盲盲打. Touch-typing is the ability to type and edit text with proper posture and without looking at your hands. This skill will have a dramatic effect on the work capacity of any student or or knowledge worker. Good touch-typing is also the most direct way to have a positive impact on spinal health.</li>
<li>Computer-related english 电脑和网络术语 Children and adults alike quite often have problems with the most basic computer-related terms. This is all the more important as remote/online learning is becoming the new normal. It is sad to see how children otherwise fluent in English struggle online because they do not understand simple words such as: browser, search-engine, sign-up, login etc</li>
<li>Code&amp;Sweat 出汗编程跳跳吧 A healthy mind in a healthy body Code&amp;Sweat is basically a sport-class where I will gradually introduce instructions/commands using python-english instead of natural english.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-2-4">
<h3 id="2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Schedule</h3>
<ul>
<li>a little bit of theory:
Each daily training consists of 3*20 mn class</li>
<li>a lot of practice:
After the theory, participants will work in pairs through their circuit-training (similar to crossfit WOD, but for coding)</li>
<li>a little bit of sweat too:
40 mn of Physical Education</li>
<li>lunch</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>
Do not hesitate to leave your questions through Line or Wechat
</p>

<ul>
<li>My child took part in former camps with you, what are the differences that we can expect?</li>

</ul>
<p>
Printed material distributed prior to each lesson
</p>

<p>
Much longer sessions (1h–&gt;3h)
Printed material distributed prior to each lesson
Daily recording of participants’ performance shared with the parents
Daily short recording of child’s performance shared with the group
Introduction of Code&amp;Sweat and online textual games
Touch-typing and computer-related English is introduced
One online textual coding game is introduced.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can my child take part in all camps?</li>

</ul>
<p>
Yes it is possible. Ideally put your kid in workdays camp and let him rest during weekends UNLESS she really wants to take part in the weekend classes. If I had the chance to register my kid to this class I would put him on 3 workdays camp and no weekend camp. If your kid can not make it to a workdays camp, weekends camps are possible as well.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Are they going to learn new things from one week to another?</li>

</ul>
<p>
Yes, there will be plenty of new things while at the same time each child will probably dedicate one hour a day to work drill knowledge from the previous day.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Coding is interesting, but I think a 1-week camp will be enough</li>

</ul>
<p>
You know best what to do. In this bootcamp series I am incorporating some very important competences (namely touch-typing and Computer-related english), so if you think that 1-week is enough I would still urge you to make sure that your child works on those 2 areas one way or another.
</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the target age?</li>

</ul>
<p>
6 till 12 I will pair match kids and have them work on their own.
</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not available in the morning, can we organize something similar in the afternoon?</li>

</ul>
<p>
Please Line of Wechat me
